<p class="worktitle">Currently a Principal Software Engineer at <a href="https://gruntwork.io">Gruntwork</a></p>

I am an experienced (10+ years) software engineer passionate about building tools to make developers’ lives easier.
Prior to joining Gruntwork, I was a founding team member at Captricity, a company building a secure digital
automation solution for enterprises operating in highly regulated industries. During my time there, I built out
Captricity’s core digitization platform from a research prototype. I eventually became specialized in Site Reliability
Engineering and successfully led the team to materialize a 10x improvement in the throughput of the digitization
platform.

In my free time, I like to tinker with my home datacenter (comprised of a mix of SBCs) and scout for new technologies to
learn (currently CUDA and GPGPU programming).
