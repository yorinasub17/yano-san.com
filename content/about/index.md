<p class="worktitle">Currently a Principal Software Engineer at <a href="https://gruntwork.io">Gruntwork</a></p>

I am an experienced (10+ years) software engineer passionate about building tools to make developers’ lives easier. As
an early employee (employee #7) of Gruntwork, I led many key initiatives in the company including the [Reference
Architecture](https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/), [Gruntwork Pipelines](https://gruntwork.io/pipelines/), EKS
and Kubernetes modules, and numerous enhancements to [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io).

Prior to joining Gruntwork, I was a founding team member (employee #4) at [Captricity (dba Vidado)](https://vidado.ai/),
a company building a secure digital automation solution for enterprises operating in highly regulated industries. During
my time there, I built out Captricity’s core digitization platform from a research prototype. I eventually became
specialized in Site Reliability Engineering and successfully led the team to materialize a 10x improvement in the
throughput of the digitization platform.

In my free time, I like to tinker with my home datacenter (comprised of a mix of SBCs) and scout for new technologies to
learn (currently CUDA and GPGPU programming).
