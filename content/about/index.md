Yoriyasu (Yori) Yano is a Principal Software Engineer at [Gruntwork](https://gruntwork.io).

Yori is an experienced (10+ years) software engineer passionate about building tools to make developers’ lives easier.
Prior to joining Gruntwork, Yori was a founding team member at Captricity, a company building a secure digital
automation solution for enterprises operating in highly regulated industries. During his time there, he built out
Captricity’s core digitization platform from a research prototype. He eventually became specialized in Site Reliability
Engineering and successfully led the team to materialize a 10x improvement in the throughput of the digitization

technologies to learn (currently CUDA and GPGPU programming).
