<p class="worktitle">Founder at <a href="https://illumitacit.com">IllumiTacit</a> and <a href="https://fensak.io">Fensak</a> (Staff level Startup Engineer with 10+ years of experience)</p>

Yori is an experienced software engineer passionate about building tools to make developers’ lives easier. Currently
Yori is working on [IllumiTacit](https://illumitacit.com), a service that helps users reuse and share LLM prompts across
a wide range of apps such as [Microsoft Office 365](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA200005621)
and [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/illumitacit/cgpanmehaobefgofidfdfbjnkmogjjab). He is also
working on [Fensak](https://fensak.io), a service that allows using branch protection in GitOps workflows without
compromise.

Yori was previously an early employee (employee #7) at Gruntwork where he led many key initiatives in the company
including the [Reference Architecture](https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/), [Gruntwork
Pipelines](https://gruntwork.io/pipelines/), EKS and Kubernetes modules, and numerous enhancements to
[Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io).

Prior to joining Gruntwork, he was a founding team member (employee #4) at [Captricity (dba Vidado)](https://vidado.ai/),
a company building a secure digital automation solution for enterprises operating in highly regulated industries. During
his time there, he built out Captricity’s core digitization platform from a research prototype. He eventually became
specialized in Site Reliability Engineering and successfully led the team to materialize a 10x improvement in the
throughput of the digitization platform.

In his free time, he likes to tinker with his home datacenter (comprised of a mix of SBCs and traditional desktops) and
scout for new technologies to learn (currently [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/) and supply chain security).
